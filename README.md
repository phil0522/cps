constraint puzzle solver for golang

## Concept
A constraint problem contains 3 components, domains, variables and constraint.
Each variable can take on values in the domain. Constraint defines relations
between variables and domains. An evalution is consistent if it does not violate
any of the constraints. An complete evaluation contains all variables and a
solution if the evalution is consistant and complete.

## Usage
